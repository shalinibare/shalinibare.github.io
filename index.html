  <h3>A brief introduction to who I am:</h3>
  <p>My name is Shalini Bare and my pronouns are she/her/hers. 
I was born and brought up in California, and later received further education in Bangalore, 
India. Currently, I am a 21-year-old senior college student majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer 
Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, desperately job-hunting for next year. </p>
  <p>Beyond academics, some of my hobbies include cycling, reading, swimming, theatre, hiking, 
drawing, photography, dancing, watching forms of world media. Speaking of which, although I'm still a 
beginner myself, you can definitely come to me for anime recommendations. I would probably suggest 
you watch Bleach, my favorite anime in the genre of sci-fi/fantasy. If you're interested, check 
out the synopsis at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(TV_series)" target="_blank">

  <p> I also love traveling and have been to over 26 countries and hope to visit more in the future. The
following are some of my favorite weekend getaway travel destinations: </p>
