  <h3>A brief introduction to Singapore:</h3>
  <p>Singapore is a Southeast Asian island city-state. I particularly like this 
location as it was the easiest to traverse, as not only is the entire island completely 
accessible through metro but also it only takes 45 minutes to go from one end of the 
island to the other. My absolute favorite is a certain region of the island that has 
different districts representing different cultures which makes it a wonderful way to 
explore the world on foot. Furthermore, Singapore is famous for its Botanical Gardens, 
Sentosa Island, Universal Studios, National University of Singapore, etc. Finally, the 
Singapore experience is not complete without eating from hawker stalls and trying Kaya Toast
and chicken rice!
