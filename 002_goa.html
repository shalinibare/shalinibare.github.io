  <h3>A brief introduction to Goa:</h3>
  <p>Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India. 
It is one of the biggest beach destinations in India, with a very vibrant and active 
nightlife. It is also very famous for its beachside shacks that provide a delicious 
variety of cuisine and beverage. I particularly favor the extreme land and water sports
found in the region. For those who prefer a more laid back approach, there is a multitude 
of historical monuments and churches, and roadside markets that also are tourist hotspots.</p>
