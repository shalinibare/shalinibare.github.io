  <h1>A Quick New York Getaway</h1>

  <h3>A brief introduction to New York City:</h3>
  <p>New York is one of the most famous and expensive cities in the United States. 
Forever known as the city that never sleeps, NYC has a fast-paced lifestyle that 
could be the perfect way to switch up from one’s monotonous everyday life. 
First-timers definitely should visit all the cliches - Statue of Liberty, 
Central Park, Broadway, Wall Street, Grand Central, Brooklyn Bridge, etc. However, if it is not 
your first time, you should definitely try exploring New York without any premade 
plans and you will most definitely find the greatest hidden gems. However, Times 
Square is the one place that should never be missed no matter the number of times 
you’ve already been there.
